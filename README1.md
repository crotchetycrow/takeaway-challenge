As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

*my approach was to create a constant in the form of TAKEAWAY_MENU which contained a hash of dishes and their prices*

*I then would create a method called list_menu that would print a list of dishes & prices*

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

*I created an Oder class that initialized with an empty basket*

*I added an add_item method that accepts arguments of dish and the quantity. It then adds that to the empty basket*
